# TicTacToe-game
Its just a simple game using dictionaries

I have created the Tic-Tac-Toe board using dictionaries in the Python.
First the user should specifiy which sign is going to play first (X or O)
Then ths user should select a specific address on the board so can be occupied by their sign. 
Each address in the board has a name and the user should select from:

't-l' for Top-left
't-m' for Top-Middle
'm-r' for Top-Right
'm-l' for Middle-left
'm-m' for Middle-Middle
'm-r' for Middle-Right
'l-l' for Low-left
'l-m' for Low-Middle
'l-r' for Low-Right

The winner is the first player/user which could get 3 signs (of their own sign) in a column,row or diogonally.
